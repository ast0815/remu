An example analysis
===================

Overview
========

These examples should give a good overview of how to use ReMU. Use it to look
up recipes or work through it step by step. Each example depends on the
previous ones. They already include the expected output, so you do not need to
run them in order. Just be aware that due to the random nature of some of the
steps, the output of later examples might change if you (re-)run earlier ones.

The experimental setup
======================

The mock experiment that is handled in these examples is quite simple. The only
properties of events are the variables ``x`` and ``y``. Only ``x`` is smeared
by the detector. The efficiency depends only on ``y``.
