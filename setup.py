long_description = """ReMU - Response Matrix Utilities

ReMU is a framework for response matrices in cross-section measurements and
general counting experiments. It offers functions to build response matrices,
and use them to compare truth-space expectation values with actual experimental
results in reconstructed space.

Systematic uncertainties about the detector response can be included in the
matrices.  Done correctly, this enables anyone to test arbitrary models against
data that was published together with a response matrix, including systematic
detector effects. Intimate knowledge of the detector is only needed to build
the response matrix, *not* to use it.
